When you have a fresh clone of the git repository, enter the command `sbt compile` in the
top-level directory to compile EpCoGen. SBT will properly install all necessary software
libraries.

We have tested with SBT versions of 1.7.1, 1.9.8, and 1.10.7.

If your Java version is too advanced for the sbt, you may need to add the
following to the build.st file to lower the associated Java version.

  javacOptions ++= Seq("-source", "11", "-target", "11"),

And then you can install an openJDK version of Java 11 and use it by setting JAVA_HOME
properly and/or configuring PATH variable appropriately.

Sample commands to run. The first column shows the time it was launched, so to generate all
evolution stages for all approaches on a Linux machine took just under an hour. And the
compiling process for all code took just about three hours.
