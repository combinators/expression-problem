1. Generated test cases often exceed length allowed to method declarations.

  a. As a stop-gap measure, these methods are arbitrarily split up, which means that the
  visitorSideEffect has test cases that do not compile because of variables defined for
  the visitor in one method but used in the other method.

2. Functional -- continue progress from before

3.

Scala-InBetween could add 'trait' capability and that could then
be exposed as an option. This is high-level change and not
object-oriented per se.

Add exceptions to newScala

Make CoGen stand alone

M9 & J8 & M2_ABS needs functional implementation of height. Should be straightforward, though I cannot figure
out how to set up the match and patterns!

Note that Java equality in methods uses the .equals() which is a problem with primitive types. Thoughts?

Trees that grow

============================

Notes: A1M3 for coco needs a full Exp and Factory. Why? Because otherwise merge accessing finalized instances from A1 are incompatible with
the finalized instances from M3. Similar argument for M3W1 and even A1M3I2


   ifEqExpr <- ffiEquals.equalityCapabilities.areEqual(expType, expValue, zero)
     where expType is expType <- toTargetLanguageType(TypeRep.Double)

It wasn't working because I had mistakenly used a type for "ep.Exp[FT]"

ALgebra had to go back to its own "dataTypeCasesWithNewOperations" for some reason.

So Coco, Trivially and Algebra all have slightly different results and it REALLY makes me curious
as to why
