1. Generated test cases often exceed length allowed to method declarations.

  a. As a stop-gap measure, these methods are arbitrarily split up, which means that the
  visitorSideEffect has test cases that do not compile because of variables defined for

2. Functional -- continue progress from before

3.

Scala-InBetween could add 'trait' capability and that could then
be exposed as an option. This is high-level change and not

M9 & J8 & M2_ABS needs functional implementation of height. Should be straightforward, though I cannot figure
out how to set up the match and patterns!

Note that Java equality in methods uses the .equals() which is a problem with primitive types. Thoughts?
