1c. In Java, something is wrong with implementation. I think we need to generate
    more factory "makeEql" methods in subsequent versions. In addition, I think

    the broken code tries to upcast objects

    Visible in ExtensibleVisitor/K2J6 (a merge) but also in ExtensibleVisitor/J3

2. Functional -- continue progress from before
